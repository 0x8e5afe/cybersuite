    "details": "A guided form to choose CVSS v3.1 metrics and produce a score + vector you can paste into tickets and reports.\n\n## Use\nFill **Base** first (facts about exploit + impact), then optionally **Temporal** (what’s true today) and **Environmental** (what’s true for your org). Copy the **vector string** and keep a short justification so others can reproduce the same score.\n\n## Choosing each Base metric (how to decide)\n### AV — Attack Vector (where the attacker must be)\nSelect the *closest* the attacker needs to be.\n- **Network (N)** if it’s reachable over IP (Internet/VPN/internal routing) and can be exploited remotely.\n- **Adjacent (A)** if the attacker must be on the same L2/L3 “near” network (same Wi-Fi/VLAN, Bluetooth, link-local, neighbor discovery).\n- **Local (L)** if exploitation requires local execution or a local account/session first (shell access, running a local binary).\n- **Physical (P)** if it needs touching the device (plugging USB, pressing buttons, attaching debugger).\n\n### AC — Attack Complexity (how many special conditions must align)\nAssume the attacker is skilled; score the *conditions*, not the attacker.\n- **Low (L)** if it works in most default/common setups with no unusual timing or prerequisites.\n- **High (H)** if it requires rare configuration, specific race timing, guessing unpredictable values, or a multi-step “only sometimes works” situation.\n\n### PR — Privileges Required (what the attacker must already have before exploiting)\nChoose the minimum privileges required *on the vulnerable component*.\n- **None (N)** if no authentication/local account is needed.\n- **Low (L)** if a standard user / limited role / basic access is needed.\n- **High (H)** if admin/root or highly privileged role is needed.\nTip: if the bug is in an **admin-only** panel/API, PR is usually **High**.\n\n### UI — User Interaction (does a user have to do something?)\nAsk: “Can the attacker trigger it alone?”\n- **None (N)** if exploitation is fully attacker-driven (scan → exploit).\n- **Required (R)** if a user must click/open/run/enable/approve (opening a document, clicking a link, installing a plugin, accepting a prompt).\n\n### S — Scope (does it break out of the vulnerable component’s security boundary?)\nAsk: “After exploit, can the attacker affect resources governed by a different authority?”\n- **Unchanged (U)** if compromise stays within the same app/service context.\n- **Changed (C)** if it crosses a trust boundary (sandbox escape, container→host, VM escape, browser→OS, low-priv app→kernel).\n\n### C / I / A — Impact on Confidentiality / Integrity / Availability\nScore the *worst credible impact* if exploited successfully.\n- **None (N)** if there’s no meaningful effect on that property.\n- **Low (L)** if impact is limited/partial (some data exposure, constrained tampering, temporary degradation).\n- **High (H)** if impact is broad/complete (read most sensitive data, arbitrary data/code changes, full service outage).\nQuick heuristics:\n- **C High** when secrets/PII/keys are broadly readable.\n- **I High** when attacker can arbitrarily change records/config or execute arbitrary code affecting correctness.\n- **A High** when service/device can be taken down hard or persistently.\n\n## Temporal (optional: adjust for today)\n- **E (Exploit Code Maturity):** pick higher when reliable public exploits/tooling exist; use **P/PoC** when only demo code exists; **U** when no exploit is known; **X** if you truly don’t know.\n- **RL (Remediation Level):** **O** if vendor patch exists, **W** for workaround-only, **U** for no fix; **X** if unknown.\n- **RC (Report Confidence):** **C** when confirmed by vendor/credible analysis, **R** when credible but not fully verified, **U** when uncertain.\n\n## Environmental (optional: tailor to your org)\n- **CR/IR/AR:** set **High** when that asset’s C/I/A matters greatly (e.g., payment DB for I, auth system for A, HR/medical records for C).\n- **Modified metrics (MAV…MA):** override Base only when your environment changes reachability/conditions/impact (e.g., service is not Internet-exposed → lower MAV). Use **X** to keep Base.\n\nTip: When uncertain, document assumptions next to the vector; the score is less important than being consistent and explainable."
